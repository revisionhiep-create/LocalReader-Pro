   LocalReader Pro - Installation
========================================

HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Extract this ZIP to any folder (this folder will be the installation home)
2. Open the extracted folder and navigate to the "dist" folder
3. Double-click "setup.exe"
4. Follow the installer prompts
5. Wait for installation to complete

THE INSTALLATION IS SELF-CONTAINED:
Everything required for LocalReader Pro—including its dependencies and configuration—is stored within the folder you extracted. The installer will:
- Check for Python 3.12+ (installs if missing)
- Install all required dependencies into the local folder
- Create Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts for easy access

After installation, launch from:
- Desktop shortcut: "LocalReader Pro"
- Or Start Menu: "LocalReader Pro"

========================================

UNINSTALL / REMOVAL:

To remove the application and its shortcuts:

1. Run `uninstall.exe` in the installation directory or Delete the "LocalReader Pro" shortcuts from your Desktop and Start Menu.
2. Delete the folder you extracted and installed it into.

To completely remove the supporting software (Python and Libraries):

1. **Uninstall Python**: Go to Windows Settings > Apps > Installed Apps, search for "Python 3.12", and select Uninstall.
2. **Remove Libraries**: If you haven't deleted the folder yet, open a terminal in the "dist" folder and run: `pip uninstall -r requirements.txt`
3. **Clear Model Cache**: Many voices and AI models are stored in your user profile. You can delete the `.cache` folder in your user directory (usually `C:\Users\<YourName>\.cache\kokoro`) to free up additional space.

========================================

MANUAL INSTALLATION (Advanced):

If you prefer manual installation without the installer:

1. Install Python 3.10-3.13
2. Open terminal in the "dist" folder
3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run: python main.py
